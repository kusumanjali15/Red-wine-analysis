# Red-wine-analysis

Here we take Red wine dataset and perform analysis by using machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression.
By applying these algorithms we find Mean Squared Error, R Squared and Adjusted R Squared values and then compare the algorithms and find which algorithm is better algorithm.
